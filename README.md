# Installation

To get started with a new project from this template, please install [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter). We recommend to install it as a global Python package:

```
    pip install cookiecutter
```

After that you can navigate to the folder you want to create your new project in and run

```
    cookiecutter https://github.com/fajost/scaffold-ds
```

To initialize your environment after creating the project, navigate to the newly created folder and run the following commands. This assumes that you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed. You can find the instruction for installing [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). If you have an old version of Poetry installed, please make sure to udpate it first.

```
    poetry update
```
